        \frametitle{Genetic variants and diseases}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Phenotypic differences between human populations are mostly coded in frequent genetic variants
            \item These genetic variants also cause different disease susceptibility
            \item Large datasets of associations have shown that many genetic variants change simultaneously susceptibility to many diseases, ie. the variants are pleiotropic
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        What is the molecular mechanism and effect of tissue of these variants?

        \frametitle{Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are variants associated with changes of quantitative phenotypes
            \item Expression (eQTL) are variants associated with changes of gene expression in a given tissue
            \item eQTLs provide a putative molecular mechanism of a variant
        \end{itemize}
        \vfill
        What are the properties of pleiotropic eQTLs?

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Compute colocalization of eQTLs and GWAS variants
            \item Split eQTLs by the number of associated disease categories
            \item Compare molecular properties of pleiotropic eQTLs
        \end{enumerate}
