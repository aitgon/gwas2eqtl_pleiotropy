  abstract         = {Many gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have published their summary statistics, which can be used to gain insight into complex human traits by downstream analyses, such as fine mapping and co-localization. However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.},

  abstract         = {Most signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits point to noncoding genetic variants with putative gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. By analyzing GWAS hits for complex traits in the UK Biobank, and cis-eQTLs from the GTEx consortium, we show that these assays systematically discover different types of genes and variants: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, while GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in numerous functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have a complex regulatory landscape across different tissue/cell types, while genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally-relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variants, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract         = {While genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have successfully elucidated the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases, understanding mechanisms that lead from genetic variation to pathophysiology remains an important challenge. Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb); http://cpag.oit.duke.edu ) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the   locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that   was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs with severe COVID-19 demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal of the   locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN), pointing to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by   may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.},
