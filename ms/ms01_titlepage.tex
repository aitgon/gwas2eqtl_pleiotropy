\begin{abstract}

Pleiotropic genetic variants affecting several phenotypes are relatively common in the genome as shown by the increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
%
Frequent variants are often located in non-coding regions and are likely gene regulatory variants.
%
In this work, I investigate the link between gene regulation and phenotype pleiotropy for frequent variants.

% Verify numbers
First I have computed the colocalization of 413 GWAS studies and 127 eQTL studies and have observed 143,119 colocalized pairs with a probability above 0.8.
%
I have categorized the GWAS phenotypes into 96 phenotypes and categories to define pleiotropic as belonging at least to two of these categories.
%
Pleiotropic variants are associated to more eQTL genes (egenes) and more eQTL tissues (etissues) but egenes do also correlate with more phenotypes.
%
These observations could be partially explained, because pleitropic variants are enriched in splicing and missense variants and bind more transcription factors.
%
These variants with the GWAS phenotypes, egenes and etissues can be explored in a public website.

In conclusion, our work suggest that pleiotropy of gene regulatory variants arise from an increase of bound transcription factors, target egenes and etissues and severity of molecular effect consequences.
