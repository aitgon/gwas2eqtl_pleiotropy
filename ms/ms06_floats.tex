    \caption{\textbf{Model of regulatory variant pleiotropy.} I have investigated three possible mechanisms of pleiotropy. \textbf{Left}, Pleiotropic variants have more eGenes that result in more functions and more phenotypes. This might arise from an enrichment of pleiotropic variants in splicing or 3' UTR regions. \textbf{Center}, I have also found that eGenes of pleiotropic variants are active in more etissues which result in more GWAS phenotypes. This might be explained from variants being bound by more transcription factors. \textbf{Left} Triplets of variant-eGene-eTissues are associated with more GWAS phenotypes, which directly affect the number of GWAS phenotypes. I have found that this might be explained by an enrichment of missense alleles.} \label{fig:beta}
